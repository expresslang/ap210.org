One of the most prevalent requirements of manufacturing industries today is the
need to exchange and share product information within and between enterprises.
This becomes almost impossible without a standardized, computer-interpretable
method of representing and communicating the data. STEP provides a common way of
defining product data, so it can be easily interpreted and used by application
processors throughout the life cycle of the product. STEP is suitable for the
standardized exchange of product data through files, as well as the sharing and
archiving of product data in databases. Since the area of application of the
STEP standard is so broad, it is issued in sections, called Parts. The Parts
known as Application Protocols (APs) define the information requirements for
exchange in a designated application area, based on: the type of product, the
supported stages in the life cycle of the product, the disciplines that create
and use the product data, the required types of product data.
