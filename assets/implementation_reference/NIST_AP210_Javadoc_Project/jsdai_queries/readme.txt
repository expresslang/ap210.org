readme.txt
This directory is configured to allow a user to include several of the
ISO 10303 documents for convenience of reference.

Due to copyright restrictions, this document as delivered to NIST does not include copies of the ISO 10303 standards.
They are available from ISO at iso.org.

If it is desired to include copies of the standards in this directory for convenience,
place the ISO 10303 documents in this directory. 
armindex.htm and mimindex.htm specify the reference locations for the following documents that are used:

ISO 10303-210,
ISO 10303-503,
ISO 10303-43.

The original locations and names are:
./ISO_10303_503,
./wg3n2602_10303_210_ed2_IS,
./WG12N6134_20110207.

The armindex.htm and mimindex.htm were created based on the 2011 editions of the ISO 10303 documents.
It may be necessary to modify links in the armindex.htm and mimindex.htm files for newer versions of the standards.
