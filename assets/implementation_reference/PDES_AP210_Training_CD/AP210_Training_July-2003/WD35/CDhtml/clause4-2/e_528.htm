A Material_addition_feature is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_267.htm"
>Design_intent_modification</A
> that describes the material that is to be added in the realization of the feature specified by the design_intent attribute inherited from Design_intent_modification.  This requirement shall be interpreted as being mathematically equivalent to the application of the regularized Boolean geometric OR operation where the design_intent is OR'd with the shape of the Material_addition_feature.</DIV
