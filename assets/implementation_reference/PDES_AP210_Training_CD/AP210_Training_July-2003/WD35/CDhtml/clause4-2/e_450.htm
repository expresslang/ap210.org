An Interconnect_module_primary_surface is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_455.htm"
>Interconnect_module_surface_feature</A
>.
An Interconnect_module_primary_surface identifies the primary surface of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_433.htm"
>Interconnect_module</A
> for fabrication and assembly purposes.  A member of <A

>Stratum</A
> if a design view of the substrate is included in the data.  An Interconnect_module_primary_surface is an approximation of the real primary surface.<DIV

>NOTE: It is not usually the case that the physical material visible on the surface of the substrate or pcb is the same material as that of the primary Stratum.  The level of information provided by this object is usually sufficient for assembly purposes, but will be in error by the thickness of the Stratum above the primary Stratum.  If more accuracy is desired, the population of <A

HREF="e_4.htm"
>Adjacent_stratum_surface_definition</A
> may be queried to determine the Stratum that is specified by only the precedent_surface attribute.  That Stratum will be the material of at least part of the surface of the substrate.  Full three-dimensional representation capability and location of individual <A
