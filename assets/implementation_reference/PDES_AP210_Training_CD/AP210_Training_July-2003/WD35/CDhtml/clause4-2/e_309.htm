An Edge_based_2d_wireframe is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_372.htm"
>Feature_shape_definition</A
>. An Edge_based_2d_wireframe is described by a two-dimensional 
graph of edges and vertices. The graph may be disconnected. Within the graph the edges do not intersect 
except at their boundaries, otherwise known as vertices. The geometry associated with a vertex shall be 
consistent with the geometry associated with any of the edges of which the vertex forms a boundary. </DIV
