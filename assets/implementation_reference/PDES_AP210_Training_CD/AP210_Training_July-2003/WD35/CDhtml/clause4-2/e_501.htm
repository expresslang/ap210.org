A Layer_qualified_layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_509.htm"
>Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence</A
> that describes the physical spacing between one of an interconnect_module_cutout, an interconnect_module_fill_area, an interconnect_module_inter_stratum_feature, an interconnect_module_stratum_feature, or an interconnect_module_via, and another of these categories of design objects.  This Application object qualifies the spacing requirement to apply within a given context as defined by a set of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_845.htm"
>Stratum</A
>.
 
The category names correspond to the category of equivalent application object names as described in Layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence.  This requirement shall be interpreted as applying to the categories of those objects. <DIV

>In domain terms, when a Via to Via spacing is to be greater than 5 mm, the encoding will be that the spacing between the reference_design_object_category whose value is interconnect_module_via and the dependent_design_object_category whose value is interconnect_module_via shall be greater than 5 mm.</LI

>In domain terms, when the distance from a cutout to a trace must be greater than 5 mm, the encoding will 
be that the spacing between the reference_design_object_category whose value is interconnect_module_cutout and the dependent_design_object_category whose value is interconnect_module_stratum_feature shall be greater than 5 mm.</LI

>Inter_stratum_extent</A
>, for the Layer_qualified_layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence.  The layer_context establishes a context within which the spacing requirement is to be met.  There may be more than one Inter_stratum_extent for a Layer_qualified_layout_spacing_requirement_occurrence.  The Inter_stratum_extent may overlap.  All Inter_stratum_extent specified shall be in the same design. </DIV
