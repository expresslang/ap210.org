An Assembly_module is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_667.htm"
>Physical_unit_design_view</A
>. An Assembly_module may be a <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_639.htm"
>Pca</A
>.
An Assembly_module is an assembly design view of a product.  This application 
object supports design reuse, modular product definitions, 
component libraries, and related technologies.  There may be discipline views that further specialize this view.<DIV

CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
>An Assembly_module could be a 
ball grid array design, an MCM design, a disk drive design,
a line card or plug-in module in a telecommunications rack,
or a line replaceable unit in an airframe or spacecraft.  Incomplete designs that 
have some specified functionality as defined by a functional definition 
may be included in a component library application, for example.  
The designs may be included in an active design by reference. At the appropriate time in the 
design phase, the single reference is replaced with individual references to the elements that compose the 
Assembly_module. Support is provided for maintaining the information necessary to trace 
back to the original Assembly_module from the released <A

>EXAMPLE: In this example (based on the previous notes), assembly technology is the process that bonds two products together (e.g., soldering, welding) by joining individual features of one product to individual features of the other product.  The Assembly_module would have two components: A <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_580.htm"
>Packaged_part</A
> and an Interconnect_module. The Interconnect_module would include a <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_490.htm"
>Land</A
> pattern designed to optimize the assembly process yield for the Packaged_part and the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_845.htm"
>Stratum</A
> stackup of the Interconnect_module combination.  Full knowledge of the Interconnect_module technology is available through the complete definition of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_638.htm"
>Passage_technology</A
> and <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_871.htm"
>Stratum_technology</A
> supported in this part of ISO 10303.  The assembly technology characteristics assigned by an enterprise may be exchanged through population of the Ee_product_category and <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_326.htm"
>Ee_product_related_product_category</A
> application objects.  Technology classification may be exchanged using the Technology application object.  If desired, <A
