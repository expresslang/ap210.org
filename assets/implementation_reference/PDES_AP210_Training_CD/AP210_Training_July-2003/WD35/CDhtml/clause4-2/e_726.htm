A Printed_connector_template is a type of a <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_730.htm"
>Printed_part_template</A
>. A Printed_connector_template is a Printed_part_template that contains contacts, each of whose function is to act as a short from an interface_terminal of a Printed_part_template to the related join_terminal of the Printed_part_template.
Each contact corresponds to one member of characterized_connector_terminal_relationship.
The contact shall be a Part_template and the geometric relationship of the shape of the contact to the shape of the Printed_connector_template shall be established by a member of Usage_view_usage_relationship.<DIV

CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
>It is redundant to have a separate functional definition that merely specifies shorts for any type of 
connector in this part of ISO 10303, because the functional definition of a short is included in the definition of the connector. That is, a functional definition that worries about shorts is not a functional definition. It is appropriate to define the location of required shorts in the physical definition, and connector is one of the places in this part of ISO 10303 where that occurs.</LI
><LI
CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
>There may be multiple simulation models associated with a connector in this part of ISO 10303. The explicit method of defining the connector 
functionality does not prohibit having multiple simulation models. This explicit method is for the purpose of supporting the standardized 
structural definition of connectivity.</LI
