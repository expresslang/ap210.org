A Seating_plane is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_561.htm"
>Non_feature_shape_element</A
> included specifically for the purpose of providing a description of an interface plane.
One primary usage in that purpose is synchronizing the two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of a package.  The seating plane simulates a mating feature when referenced as an interface_plane.
The seating plane simulates the interconnect substrate surface in the definition view of a package, where it is referenced in the role of a package_seating_plane or die_seating_plane.  When represented by a three-dimensional plane the normal shall represent the mating surface.  The normal vector shall be in the Z axis and shall be at the origin of the defining coordinate system for the three-dimensional case.  A Seating_plane scope shall be a Bare_die, or a Package.</DIV
