A Design_intent_modification is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_524.htm"
>Managed_design_object</A
>. A Design_intent_modification may be one of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_528.htm"
>Material_addition_feature</A
>, <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_533.htm"
>Material_removal_feature</A
>, or <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_536.htm"
>Material_shape_modification</A
>. A 
Design_intent_modification provides capabilities to archive design intent along with constraint based modifications so that if a constraint 
is removed the original design intent, or a part thereof, may be restored.<DIV
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><P
></P
>EXAMPLE: This example shows how this part of ISO 10303 may be used to exchange or archive design intent for the case of a power plane where there is penetration of the power plane by other signals. Figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim1</SPAN
> is the original design intent for Power Plane 1 that is captured in a member of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_184.htm"
>Connected_filled_area</A
>(#1).
Figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim2</SPAN
> is the original design intent for Power Plane 2 that is captured in a member of Connected_filled_area (#2).
Figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim3</SPAN
> is the original design intent for <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_823.htm"
>Signal</A
> 3 that is captured in a member of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_176.htm"
>Conductor</A
>(#3).
In order to accomplish the embedding of Power Plane 2 into Power Plane 1 and in order to accomplish the embedding of Signal 3 into the result of the previous embedding, a sequence is followed. In order to meet requirements, constraints must be satisfied regarding 
spacing of conductive areas. These constraints are specified by the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_330.htm"
>Ee_requirement_occurrence</A
>. Note that the following method is 
based on the relative priority of the signal and the two power planes. This example assumes that the conductor has the highest priority for area, followed by Power Plane 2 followed by Power Plane 1 which has the lowest priority.

Step 1: Create three "design intent" Stratum_features as above. Note that these features are a permanent part of the design.

Step 2: Create a member of Material_removal_stratum_feature_template (see figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim4</SPAN
>) for the spacing requirement 
to be met between Power Plane 2 and Power Plane 1. This template shape is dependent on the voltage between Power Plane 2 and 
Power Plane 1. The distance between the outer extent of Power Plane 2 and the outer extent of the template shape is explicitly stated 
in the electrical_isolation_spacing_requirement between the Power Plane 2 and Power Plane 1. Populate member of 
Electrical_isolation_material_removal_structure to capture the stated relationships and properties. For further reference in this example, 
this member will be called 1.

Step 3: Create a Material_removal_stratum_feature_template (see figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim5</SPAN
>) for the spacing requirement to be
met between Signal 3 and Power Plane 1. This template shape is 
dependent on the voltage between Signal 3 and Power Plane 1. The distance between the outer extent of Signal 3 and the outer extent 
of the template shape is explicitly stated in the electrical_isolation_spacing_requirement between the Signal 3 and Power Plane 1. 
Populate a member of Electrical_isolation_material_removal_structure to capture the stated relationships and properties. For further 
reference in the example, this member will be called 2.

Step 4: Create a Material_removal_stratum_feature_template (see figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim6</SPAN
>) for the spacing requirement to be 
met between Signal 3 and Power Plane 2. This template shape is dependent on the voltage between Signal 3 and Power Plane 2. The 
distance between the outer extent of Signal 3 and the outer extent of the template shape is explicitly stated in the 
electrical_isolation_spacing_requirement between the Signal 3 and Power Plane 2. Populate a member of 
Electrical_isolation_material_removal_structure to capture the stated relationships and properties. For further reference in the example, 
this member will be called 3. As a summary at this point, all the design intent shapes are defined; all the electrical isolation 
shapes are defined.

See figure  <SPAN
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
>dim7</SPAN
> for the result achieved by a processor in conformance with this part of ISO 10303, in support of a CAD application, or in support of a manufacturing application.
Since Signal 3 has a higher priority than Power Plane 2, the precedent_modification attribute specifies Electrical_isolation_material_removal_structure #1 and the 
subsequent_modification specifies Electrical_isolation_material_removal_structure #2</DIV
