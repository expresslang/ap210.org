A Primary_stratum_indicator_symbol is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_834.htm"
>Special_symbol_laminate_component</A
> that is used to identify the arbitrarily named primary side of a printed circuit board.<DIV
CLASS="NOTE"

>NOTE: This symbol may be found in the stratum material of the conductive stratum that is on the primary side of the printed circuit board, implemented in a stratum of silk-screen printed marking ink on the primary side, or otherwise. The primary side is normally defined as that side of the printed circuit board which will contain the largest number of components, but in cases where the component count is balanced, the primary side is arbitrarily named for convenience. Not all printed circuit boards contain this symbol.</DIV
