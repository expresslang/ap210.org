A Component_feature_to_physical_usage_view_assignment is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_524.htm"
>Managed_design_object</A
>. A 
Component_feature_to_physical_usage_view_assignment
is the association between the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_613.htm"
>Part_feature</A
> and the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_118.htm"
>Component_feature</A
>. The 
purpose for this assignment 
is to link the product data in the design view to the product data in the usage view for traceability purposes.<DIV

>In an archive, both a design view and a usage view are archived together, with this relationship 
populated as necessary to provide linkages between the features in the usage view and the features in the 
design view. Without this linkage populated, there is no way to guarantee traceability between a design 
view and a usage view, without evaluating the design view and the usage view in detail.</LI

CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
>In the case where this part of ISO 10303 is used to exchange or store designs that may be used in higher level 
assemblies, the usage view is provided to the designers of those higher level assemblies, and this entity 
allows the interface definitions to the next level assemblies to be carefully controlled. Note that the 
usage view is an as-designed view. The requirements unit of functionality in this part of ISO 10303 supports the 
as-required view of the interface to the next higher assembly in a top-down design paradigm. This part of ISO 10303 
supports explicitly exchanging those data separately so that traceability is provided from requirements to 
as-designed life-cycle states in the same exchange file.</LI
