An Assembly_group_component is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_34.htm"
>Assembly_component</A
>. An Assembly_group_component may be either one or both of 
an <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_29.htm"
>Array_placement_group</A
> or an <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_459.htm"
>Interfaced_group_component</A
>.  Each component that is part of a group is in the same design view as that group.<DIV

>The intent is for all members of Assembly_component that are also in the role of related_components for Sub_assembly_relationship to be placed as a group in a placement activity using a CAD tool.  However, each member of the group is placed individually in this standard.  A receiving system should treat the relative placement of members of the group as derived data.</LI

associated by the sub_assembly_relationship entity to this application object one of the lines to be paired.

CLASS="DESCRIPTION"
>The components is an inverse relationship that specifies that the existence of the Assembly_group_component is dependent on the existence of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_878.htm"
>Sub_assembly_relationship</A
> that specifies the Assembly_group_component as its relating_component.  There shall be one or more Sub_assembly_relationship for an Assembly_group_component.<DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><P

>NOTE: The usual case is for one member of Sub_assembly_relationship to associate all relating components, but more than one is permitted.  There is no semantic difference in this part of ISO 10303 between all the components being related with one member of Sub_assembly_relationship or each of the component being related having its own Sub_assembly_relationship.</DIV
