A Primary_reference_terminal is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_591.htm"
>Package_terminal</A
>.
This terminal is assigned the first identifier string in the 
sequence of package terminal names to be assigned to the part.  The Primary_reference_terminal
shall not specify a precedent_feature and is the first member of the sequence of Package_terminal.
The sort order of the names assigned to the Packaged_terminals is defined
by the explicit sequence established by the use of precedent_feature inherited from Part_feature.<DIV

>EXAMPLE: If a value of '1' is available, assigning a value of '2' to this terminal 
would be prohibited by this part of ISO 10303, due to the possibility of confusion.</DIV

>NOTE: The Primary_reference_terminal is often associated with an orientation 
feature, but it may not be the orientation feature itself.  Usually the 
Primary_reference_terminal and the  <A

>Primary_orientation_feature</A
>
 are
different part_features.</DIV
