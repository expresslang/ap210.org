An Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_524.htm"
>Managed_design_object</A
>. An 
Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship 
is the association between one <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_330.htm"
>Ee_requirement_occurrence</A
> and another, with a defined type of relationship.  An Operational_requirement_occurrence_relationship is an incompletely modeled concept and shall be combined with members of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_770.htm"
>Requirement_composition</A
> to form a complete requirement.</DIV

><DIV
CLASS="APPOBJREGATTRDESC"

CLASS="DESCRIPTION"
>The relationship_type specifies one of the following:<DIV

><LI
CLASS="LISTITEM"

><LI
CLASS="LISTITEM"
>an OR_OPERATION</LI
><LI
CLASS="LISTITEM"
>a DERIVED_FROM relationship</LI
></UL
></DIV
>

The mathematical operations AND, OR shall be implemented for this relationship_type.
DERIVED_FROM only asserts a dependency relationship.  The AND_OPERATION is provided so that changes in relationship_type from OR_OPERATION to AND_OPERATION do not cause a structural change to the populated data.  The implicit relationship between two member of Ee_requirement_occurrence that help to compose the same Requirement_group_occurrence is an AND relationship.</DIV
