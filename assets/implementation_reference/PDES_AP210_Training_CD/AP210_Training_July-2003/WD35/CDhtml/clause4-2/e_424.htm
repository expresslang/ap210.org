A Geometric_tolerance_with_applied_material_condition_property is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_421.htm"
>Geometric_tolerance</A
> that specifies or partially specifies the design requirement on one or more geometric characteristics of the toleranced <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_810.htm"
>Shape_element</A
> in which the restrictiveness of the requirement is dependent on the actual size of the produced Shape_element or the actual size of the produced Shape_element from which the toleranced Shape_element is derived. A Geometric_tolerance_with_applied_material_condition_property in which the applied_material_condition_property_name is "maximum_material_principle" participates in specifying a requirement that is less stringent as the produced Shape_element deviates from its maximum material condition towards its least material condition. In this case, the specified size of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_915.htm"
>Tolerance_zone_boundary</A
> is the base size from which it is increased by the amount the produced Shape_element deviates from its maximum material condition towards its least material condition. A Geometric_tolerance_with_applied_material_condition_property in which the applied_material_condition_property_name is "least_material_requirement" participates in specifying a requirement that is less stringent as the produced Shape_element deviates from its least material condition towards its maximum material condition. In this case the specified size of the Tolerance_zone_boundary is the base size from which it is increased by the amount the produced Shape_element deviates from its least material condition towards its maximum material condition.
