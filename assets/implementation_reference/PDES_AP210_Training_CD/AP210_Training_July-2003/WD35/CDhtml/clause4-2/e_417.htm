The Geometrically_bounded_surface is a surface that does not include topological 
information as to what edges are shared between surfaces.  Only geometric information 
is supplied, which is useful only for presentation purposes.  This entity should not 
be used to convey connectivity-related data unless independent connectivity reconstruction
and verification is performed.</DIV
