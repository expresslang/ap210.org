An Interconnect_module is a type of <A

An Interconnect_module may be an aggregation of <A

CLASS="DESCRIPTION"
>The assembly_design_requirement specifies the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_43.htm"
>Assembly_module</A
> for the Interconnect_module as a specified source of requirements not otherwise explicitly allocated to the Interconnect_module.  This requirement shall be interpreted as establishing a direct relationship to the assembly or assemblies that define data that may be used as requirements for the Interconnect_module.  There may be more than one Assembly_module for a Interconnect_module.  The assembly_design_requirement is optional and need not be supplied.<DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
></P
>NOTE: This relationship is provided so that design requirements may be traced to the original source even though an Interconnect_module may be designed into many subsequent assembly designs.</DIV
></DIV
></DIV
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
></P
>NOTE: Explicit data requirements may be contained in one or more assembly design views.  These multiple requirements can be specified by the the Componenet_external_reference and Component_feature_external_reference application objects.  Component features which are contained in one design view may be associated to layout features that are contained in another design view. Component_external_reference and Component_feature_external_reference maintain this association while also maintaining the completeness of the design view.</DIV

specified by the supertype Ee_product_definition is "Interconnect module", and if the sub category of the Ee_product_category is "land pattern", then the purpose for inclusion is to provide land pattern source data that may be manufacturer specific or industry standard. The attribute standard_product_indicator specified by the same member of Ee_product shall be true for industry standard pattern and material designation.
The material designations, arrangement, etc., are included as part of this definition since this application object is a design view. The instantiation of the land pattern into the design is accomplished using the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_126.htm"
>Component_make_from_relationship</A
> to specify each component of the land pattern as it is reused in the design. 
The Application Objects <A

HREF="e_595.htm"
>Padstack_definition</A
> and  <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_388.htm"
>Footprint_definition</A
> are provided to allow specific usages of patterns generally understood in industry to be exchanged.  It is suggested to use a Footprint_definition to exchange land patterns instead of the generic mechanism.</DIV
