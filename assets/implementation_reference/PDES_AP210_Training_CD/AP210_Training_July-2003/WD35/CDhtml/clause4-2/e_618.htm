A Part_interface_access_feature is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_613.htm"
>Part_feature</A
> that is 
identified to facilitate tolerance specification when an occurrence of the associated part is used in an assembly.  Specifically the intent is to provide identification that the function of the Part_feature is to provide access via a void in the material to internal components or terminals, which have been identified as having some function at the Part level, e.g., are Part_terminals.  The material_state_change attribute inherited from Part_feature shall be material_removal.<DIV

>EXAMPLE: The reset button in a notebook computer requires a Part_interface_access_feature whose properties are coupled to the reset button to ensure correct functionality of the end product.</DIV

The accessed_interface is the feature for which the Part_interface_access_feature provides access.<DIV
CLASS="NOTE"

>NOTE: The accessed_interface is at the same level of design hierarchy as the Part_interface_access_feature for consistency purposes.
It is anticipated that component_feature_to_physical_usage_view_assignment will be populated as necessary to support the design process peculiar to the enterprise.</DIV

The accessed_interface specifies the role of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_613.htm"
>Part_feature</A
> for the Part_interface_access_feature.
The interface_access_connection_area provides a means to geometrically specify an area for critical mechanical interface_access properties.  The Connection_zone area is void of material.</DIV
