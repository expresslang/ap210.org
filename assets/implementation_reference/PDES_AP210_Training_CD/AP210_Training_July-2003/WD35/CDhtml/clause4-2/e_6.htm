An Advanced_b_rep is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_80.htm"
>Bound_volume_shape</A
> that represents the shape of a part or an aspect of the shape of a part 
by an advanced boundary representation solid model. 
This representation allows for the curves and 
surfaces and the topology that binds them. 
Boundaries are explicitly defined only by topology. 
All of the 
geometry that defines the shape of a part or an aspect of the shape of a part must be associated with 
topology.</DIV
