A Gate_path_swap_specification is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_95.htm"
>Change_design_object_management_relationship</A
>. This entity explicitly states that a path to a functional unit in a design shall be changed to a new path in the 
library of functional unit definitions.
<DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
></P
>NOTE: Normally the new path is based on the same root functional 
unit definition in the library, leading to a different path in the same technology, but there is no restriction in 
the standard that prohibits switching to a different functional unit definition in the library. If there is a new 
functional unit definition as root, other design changes will likely need to occur, but the mapping to 
identify those explicitly and relate them to this entity is not standardized, except through the use of the 
requirement_occurrence concept. Specifically, this entity needs to be used in conjunction with the 
component swap specification to swap between components if the path in the library is also changing.</DIV

another microcircuit and terminal, U2-C.</DIV
