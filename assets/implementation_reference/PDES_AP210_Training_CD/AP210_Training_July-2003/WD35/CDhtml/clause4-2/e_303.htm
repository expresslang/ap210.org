A Directed_axis is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_561.htm"
>Non_feature_shape_element</A
> that is an axis in which 
a direction is defined. A Directed_axis is defined by a base <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_90.htm"
>Centre_axis</A
>, with 
which the Directed_axis is congruent, and two <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_810.htm"
>Shape_element</A
> through which the 
base Centre_axis passes or would pass if the Shape_elements were extended. One of the two 
Shape_elements is specified as the start_shape_element and the other one specified as the 
end_shape_element. </DIV
