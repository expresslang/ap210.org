A Cutout is a type of <A

>. A 
Cutout may be a <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_655.htm"
>Physical_connectivity_interrupting_cutout</A
>.  A Cutout is a closed, internal shape in a substrate.  A Cutout may not extend completely through the substrate.  Complex Cutouts may be created by using the facilities in <A

Each end of the internal conductor path shown in the figure that mates with a component terminal should be modeled as an <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_438.htm"
>Interconnect_module_component_terminal</A
>.  During design of the interconnect substrate, thees features would be considered as interface features whose location is controlled by the mating requirement.  In this example the mating requirement is simplified because the component is not a connector.</LI
