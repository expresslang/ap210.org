Signal in this part of ISO 10303 is an abstraction of signal as categorized according to an ISO or IEC standard.
Signal in this part of ISO 10303 is specifically included for the purpose of exchanging information related to functional abstractions of products as commonly specified on data sheets.
There is no predefined mechanism in this part of ISO 10303 that defines standard physical arrangement of instrumentation and test articles to support test processes.
This part of ISO 10303 provides a standard mechanism to associate sets of data that characterize the behaviour of a product with the functional hierarchical model and physical geometric model of that product.<DIV
