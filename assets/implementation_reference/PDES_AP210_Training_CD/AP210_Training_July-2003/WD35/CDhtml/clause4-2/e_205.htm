A Curve_style is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_524.htm"
>Managed_design_object</A
>. A Curve_style is the definition of a set of properties that are of a geometric nature.
Curve_style provides parametric data used by a processor to create physical material along a path, where the path is described outside of the style.  The Curve_style algorithm is rule based and is formally described in the domain rules.  The width_uncertainty represents the uncertainty in the originating CAD system, not a material processing tolerance.</DIV
