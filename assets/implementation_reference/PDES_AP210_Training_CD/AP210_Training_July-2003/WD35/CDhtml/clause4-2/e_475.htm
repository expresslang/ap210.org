>The types of Inter_stratum_join_implementation correspond to two physical implementation mechanisms.</LI

CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
> The first mechanism consists of creating a passage or edge in the material and then adding conductive material to the passage or edge wall and features on the to_stratum and from_stratum of the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_470.htm"
>Inter_stratum_extent</A
>. This mechanism results in a connection between the required features implemented with the passage or edge wall.</LI
><LI
CLASS="NOTEINGROUP"
>The second mechanism does not result in a conducting passage, but relies on a bond (achieved either by direct deposition or some other means) between the features related to the specified layer_connection_points. The second mechanism usually relies on a passage in only the dielectric material separating the bonded materials. A cross-sectional view of the pcb may show a vertical displacement of strata in the area of this object, due to the fact that the dielectric <A

>Stratum</A
> is much thicker than the conductive Stratum. The shape of the vertical displacement is not a part of the definition of the Inter_stratum_join_implementation when the second mechanism is used.</LI

>NOTE: The following is a description of a realization of an Inter_stratum_join_implementation appropriate for some 
technologies. Features that implement inter layer connection are realized by forming passages in the 
sequence of stratum that define the extent of the passage. The passage has a nominally uniform cross-section and 
has a direction normal to the surface specified as the from_stratum. If that surface is not planar, then the 
surface coordinates of the layer connection points vary layer to layer to account for the finite 
thickness of the stratum comprising the Stratum.</DIV
