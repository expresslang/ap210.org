An Apex is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_260.htm"
>Derived_shape_element</A
> that is either a point that is derived by projecting a conical surface or 
the common point that is derived by projecting two or more conical surfaces. The <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_810.htm"
>Shape_element</A
> from which 
the Apex is derived are associated with the Apex by the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_814.htm"
>Shape_element_deriving_relationship</A
> that are specified as the 
deriving_relationships.</DIV
