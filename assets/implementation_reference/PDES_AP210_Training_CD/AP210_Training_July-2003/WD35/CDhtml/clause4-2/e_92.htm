A Centre_plane is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_91.htm"
>Centre_of_symmetry</A
> that is planar in form. The <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_810.htm"
>Shape_element</A
> derived from the Centre_plane is associated with the Centre_plane by the <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_814.htm"
>Shape_element_deriving_relationship</A
> that are
specified as the deriving_relationships.</DIV

>The precise interpretation of a Centre_plane is context dependent.
That is, the distinction is not made between the centre plane of a feature
and a derived median plane of a feature as defined in  1.3 of ASME Y14.5M.</LI

consists of two opposing surfaces of a notch (or tab).</DIV
