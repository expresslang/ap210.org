A Shape_element_constituent_relationship is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_816.htm"
>Shape_element_relationship</A
> that associates a <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_810.htm"
>Shape_element</A
> with a second Shape_element to which the first Shape_element is a constituent. The Shape_element that is the constituent Shape_element is specified as the related_shape_element. The Shape_element to which the constituent Shape_element is a constituent is specified as the relating_shape_element. A Shape_element_constituent_relationship may be a <A

>The difference between a Shape_element_constituent_relationship and a 
Shape_element_composing_relationship is that the Shape_element_constituent_relationship is used to 
indicate that a Shape_element is part of another Shape_element. However, the 
Shape_element_composing_relationship is used to completely specify the composition of a 
Composite_shape_element.</LI

>EXAMPLE: A Shape_element_constituent_relationship might be used to indicate that a Datum_target is on the bottom surface of a printed circuit 
board. In this case, the Shape_element that is the Datum_target would be specified as the related_shape_element, and the 
Shape_element that is the bottom surface of the printed circuit board would be specified as the relating_shape_element.</DIV
