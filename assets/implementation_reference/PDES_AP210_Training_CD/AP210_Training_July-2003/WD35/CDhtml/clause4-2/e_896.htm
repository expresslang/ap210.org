A Test_requirement_occurrence is a type of <A
CLASS="INTERNALREF"
HREF="e_330.htm"
>Ee_requirement_occurrence</A
> that specifies a test related requirement.  The test method shall be specified in the requirement_specification inherited from Ee_requirement_occurrence.  The Test_requirement_occurrence provides a representation of minimum bounds on behaviour.
In order to relate a Test_requirement_occurrence to a product, a Requirement_allocation is required to be exchanged that references this Application Object and the version of the product to which the test requirement is allocated.
That Requirement_allocation shall also specify a number of Part_feature_analytical_model_port_assignment in order to specify the measurement access points for the test.  It is valid to exchange a Test_requirement_occurrence without a Requirement_allocation
Either an Analytical_representation shall be provided or a Functional_specification shall be provided.<DIV
