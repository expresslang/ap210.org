A Delete_design_object_management_relationship is a type of <A

Together with Change_design_object_management_relationship and
Add_design_object_management_relationship,
Delete_design_object_management_relationship supports the
exchange of changes to a design by the use of a data set
containing only (1) the information necessary to identify the
design (e.g., an Ee_product_definition or an Ee_product_version),
which is assumed to be already known to the receiving system, and
(2) the design objects that have been added, changed, or deleted.<DIV
