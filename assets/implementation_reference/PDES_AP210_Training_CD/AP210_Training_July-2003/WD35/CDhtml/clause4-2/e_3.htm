>NOTE: Together with Change_design_object_management_relationship and
Delete_design_object_management_relationship,
Add_design_object_management_relationship supports the exchange
of changes to a design by the use of a data set containing only
(1) the information necessary to identify the design (e.g., an
Ee_product_definition or an Ee_product_version), which is assumed
to be already known to the receiving system, and (2) the design
objects that have been added, changed, or deleted.  Note that all
the quality and structural requirements defined in this part of ISO 10303
may also apply to the resultant new design iteration.</DIV
