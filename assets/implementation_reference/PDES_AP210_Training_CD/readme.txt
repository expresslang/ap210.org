This is a readme file for the AP210 Course DVD set and CD.

1- Notes on the version of AP210 (ISO 10303-210) discussed in the training
Working Draft 35 is the version referenced in the training.  This version is
not the final version.  At the time of the creation of the training, there
were some issues still unresolved that could have a minor impact on the 
training documentation.

http://step.nasa.gov/sparkynet/bugs is the current list of issues.
Stephen Waterbury of NASA is the administrator for the site.

http://step.nasa.gov/sparkynet is the master repository for working drafts.

2- Notes on watching video
Video Structure:
The structure of the video is three level: DVD disc, program, chapter
Each disc is partitioned into one or more programs.
Each program is partitioned into five minute segments (chapters).

Note: Video players use different nomenclature to refer to the elements
of the video.

Disc set:
There are two DVD discs.
The first disc has three programs and the second disc has four programs.

The viewer should follow along with the video using the files on the presentation CD.  
The presentation CD is organized to complement the video.
A Table of Contents is provided to assist that process.
When powerpoint files cover more than one program, the particular slides needed
for that program are identified in the Table of Contents.

The viewer may wish to reduce the size of the video frame so most of
the screen is available for the powerpoint files.
Most video play applications respond to the "space bar" by pausing the
video.  Tapping the "space bar" again resumes play.

3- Additional information
There are additional powerpoint presentations and other files provided 
on the CD (see list below). Some of these were discussed off-camera during
the course, while others were not used during the course itself.
These are included on the CD for reference purposes. 
See http://www.ap210.org/ for further information and the latest news.
