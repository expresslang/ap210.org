============other issues========
1- why two seating_plane instances
validated July 27-- Jamie to condense.

2- No more than one GEOMETRIC_ITEM_SPECIFIC_USAGE shall reference a specific instance of shape_aspect.
Use item_identified_representation_usage or a subtype of that to associate two faces to a shape_aspect.

3-    DATUM_REFERENCE_COMPARTMENT

   Instance: 1375738197 (stepId: #1338)
          ERROR: Violating WHERE rule: GENERAL_DATUM_REFERENCE.WR1
    9 places, fixed NEED BLANK STRING.
validated July 27 -- Jamie to remove contents

4-dimensional_size.name should be 'thickness' not length according to pmi rec prac v3.6, table 4.
We need to add 'length' to that or would 'thickness' work?

6-We should use geometric_tolerance_with_modifiers rather than modified_geometric_tolerance.
modified_geometric_tolerance is not yet deprecated but it should be. The modifier value is the same.
Jamie will look at


7- package_body, primary_reference_terminal, and package_terminal attribute 'product_definitional' should be .TRUE., right?
agreed to make the change.
