Note the EMPilot file has some components without height or locations defined.
See empilot.txt and empilot.jpg for the details.

READY
The EMpilot and the ITI translators represent the component height differently.
The EMpilot representation_item has a name of "maximum body clearance about seating plane".
The ITI representation_item has a name of "maximum height about seating plane".
The correct name is "maximum height above seating plane".
The rational for this is that the ARM attribute maximum_height_above_seating_plane NOT optional.  Given a planar interconnect_module the two attributes should have the same value.

See getPackagedComponentHeight() for an implementation that supports both.

In the product_definition_relationship with a name of "used package" in the EMpilot translator
the packaged_part is referenced by the related_product_definition attribute, in the ITI
translator the package_part is referenced by the relating_product_definition.
As the mapping for packaged_part to package (as used_package) below shows the ITI implementation is correct.

(packaged_part <=)
(externally_defined_packaged_part <=
externally_defined_physical_unit <=)
(library_defined_packaged_part <=
library_defined_physical_unit <=
externally_defined_physical_unit <=)
physical_unit <=
product_definition <-
product_definition_relationship.relating_product_definition
{product_definition_relationship
product_definition_relationship.name = `used package'}
product_definition_relationship
product_definition_relationship.related_product_definition ->
{product_definition
product_definition.frame_of_reference ->
product_definition_context <=
application_context_element
application_context_element.name = `physical design usage'}
product_definition =>
physical_unit =>
package

See getPackagedComponentPackage() for an implementation that supports both.

The ITI interconnect implementation is quite different then the empilots
and doesn't follow the recommended practices.
This results in the following.

The interconnect physical_units are different check out CAP210ViewerDoc::OnOpenDocument.
The board outline shape reps are different checkout GetBoardOutlineShapeRep and
GetRockwellBoardOutlineShapeRep. To be expected at this point.
