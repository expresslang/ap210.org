Folks,
        Wrong IDF Board file. The one here is it.

Tom, Kevin and Mike,
        Tom explained there have been some discussions of IDF vs 210
orientation issues. Tom asked me to create an IDF file with a component
instanced along a constant X line where the first instance has a 0 degree
angle, the second has a 10 degree angle and the third has a 30 degree
angle. The component should be instanced on both the top and bottom of the
board. Attached are: the IDF board file, the IDF library file, a 203 file
created from these, a picture of the top of the board from AutoCAD and a
picture of the bottom of the board from AutoCAD. The last two pictures
result from the import of the 203 file.
        The MCAD vendors have decided en-mass to reject CTO3D as a method
of placing anything other than mirrored geometry. Most 99.9% do not support
mirrored geometry at all (they reinstance it). This is still a matter of
discussion.
        The 203 file here uses A2P3D and CDSR to instance components. This
should not matter as the information is similar. The MCAD vendors do not
like to mix CTO and A2P since the vectors are different. For CTO, the first
vector is the inherent X direction. For A2P, it is the inherent Z
direction. It is too easy to screw this up.
        One thing I noted in the ITI Mentor translator files I saw (not
sure if they are the latest) is that the A2P instances assumed the first
direction was X. This is not the case. It is Z. This will cause holes in
the board to be sideways (viewed edge on) when looking at the board from
the top or bottom. I mentioned this to Paul Monson and he said he would
look into it.
        For the issue here (flipping geometry for the bottom of the board
vs the top), the CTO is

#181=CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_2D('','','',$,$,#611,$);

for the top and

#181=CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_2D('','','',#451,#452,#611,$);
#451=DIRECTION('',(1.,0.));
#451=DIRECTION('',(0.,-1.));
#611=CARTESIAN_POINT('',(0.,0.));

for the bottom.
