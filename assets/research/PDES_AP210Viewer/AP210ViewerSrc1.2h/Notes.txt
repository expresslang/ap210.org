July 4th, 1999

Need to get points for Boards and Component References.  
Look at the SDAI instance passed in to create them.  
Will need to get some code from ExtractGeometry. (DONE)

Need to look into what I will need from glut.
I'd like to eliminate glut and use straight opengl
this should be easy since I've the source to glut.


Got AP210LP and AP210Line to compile, now need to extract the lines 
into a list for the board.  (DONE)

Memory leak in ComponentReference::Draw is where 
I need to build a OpenGL data structure.

Need to get the Tess routines working.  In particular the
callback assignments in Tess.cpp (DONE)

Got the board and components to display, need to look
into the best lighting, color model.

Added mouse move message handler need filter left mouse down/move 
event and use panning from glut-3.6\progs\examples\halomagic.c

Need to figure out why print preview doesn't work.
(It's a basic problem with MFC and OpenGl.)

Working on updating the lighting modes in viewer define TESTING
to turn on the trial. (DONE)


The repaint from the mouse move and OnSize cause the window
to go black, most likely a problem with OnDraw. (FIXED)


July 11th, 1999
Need to look into where the board is on a redraw.
A hunch: The problem is most likely that I need to back off -10
in the Z axis Dino must have been draw to see from the Origin?

Don't glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE) since the faces are created properly
need create them all with the same winding.  Could be a
side affect of the tess routine, might be be worth looking into.
Look at extrudeSolidFromPolygon() in dinospin.c

Need to incorporate trackball.c for mouse moves. Just define TRACKBALL,
need to intergrate with zooming and testwith scrolling.

Need to inplement picking. See triselect.c for an example.
(DONE MTK 12/99)

July 29, 1999

Need to create OpenGl rendering contexts for both the screen and printing.
Since the screen and printing devices have different pixel formats.

August 19, 1999
Moved AP210Model to CAP210ViewerDoc in order to be able to display more than one 
model at a time.  CAP210ViewerView::ScaleDisplay() is a problem since it looks at
all the BoardComponents in AP210Object::list need to have a seperate list for each
CAP210ViewerDoc.

August 29, 1999
Created PWBDataBase class to act as the interface between documents
and the PWB viewer.

If a flasher.stp and flasher.p21 file are loaded they share the same model,
then if one is closed and error occurs when the other is closed.  Need to
look into this. They are sharing the same SdaiModel but not the same document!
What to do? (DONE MTK 01/30/00)

Since the CIDFDoc doesn't do anything, PWB is null which is a bad thing.
Need to throw a loadSave exception, in serialize since I want to use that
to load the data.


Nov 7th 1999

Need to seperate the translations for a display from the actual display.
This will allow translation, setting up the pick matrix and display for selection.
(DONE MTK 12/99)

Nov 10th 1999

To handle arcs sweep the start point through the degress using the translation 
code currently available. Sweeping the angle to zero would give the proper
direction of the arc. (MTK DONE)

Dec 6th 1999
Need to clean up AP210 lines and lists after OpenGl is created, or at least
when the model document is closed. (MTK DONE 12/18/99)

Dec 22nd 1999

Need to move the code that manipulates the projection matrix in
CAP210ViewerView::OnSize so that it can be called from DoSelect
to restore the projection matix, OR push and pop the matrix.
(DONE MTK 12/99 - Created Perspective())

Dec. 28 1999

Need to make registry location a constant and check rose value.
(MTK DONE 1/1/2000)

Jan. 1 2000

Need to set the names of the IDF to AP210 ExpressX files in the registry.
IDFToAP210ARM -      idf_v2_to_ap210dis_299_40_EXPX
AP210ARMToAP210AIM - ap210dis_299_40_to_aim_EXPX
(MTK DONE 1/1/2000)


Jan 1. 2000

Need to look into fixing save as problem for IDF files, I'd like to 
be able to save idf, arm and aim.


CDocManager::DoPromptFileName() might be better since it is virtual.

Would need to create a CDocManager subclass and set it InitApplication()

Created AP210DocManager::DoPromptFileName(),  now need to look into what to do!

Getting there on Jan 8th, just need to check the file extension in SaveDocument and 
save the correct file.
(MTK DONE 1/9/2000)

Jan 6. 2000

Need to pick up mechanical components from AP210 files put there by the IDF translator.
First need to update CAP210ViewerDoc::BuildPackagedComponents() to properly go thru the
assembly physical_unit currently in looks for all the packaged_components.
(Wait for final version of AP210 Translator)

Jan 8. 2000

Craig Lanning asked for the ap210 file extension, created the IOAP210 class that lets
you define a format and file extension. The defaults are "step" and "ap210".
This would be the basis for allowing users to define there own extensions.
(MTK DONE 1/9/2000)

Jan 9. 2000 

There is a problem that confuses ROSE and you can't load additional files.  I think
it is related to loading a model when there is already one there with the same name.
I need to check for this rather than corrupt the database, It would be nice
to have each type of file have it's own name related to its format
(e.g. mechidf, mechap210, mechidfstp, etc).

Jan 13. 2000

To solve my problems with opening multiple models, Possibly I need to create a 
repository for each Document. (DONE MTK 01/30/00 - used a ROSE function to find the design)

Jan 26. 2000
Have gotten the selection to work with the "Package" data model. Have noticed
that when a new window is opened there are no components only the board.
(FIX MTK 1/27/00)

Jan 29. 2000
Did some work on display the entire board when it is first displayed. Works OK
but some boards are still hidden a little, needs some work.

Jan 30. 2000
onCloseDocument currently messes with the files attribute to make sure they don't get
deleted.  Look into RoseInterface's deleteRoseDesign function it states that it only
deletes the in memory model.

Feb 13, 2000
Working with Version 1.2 of ITI translator. Fixed problem with Rockwell IDF files.
It appears that the units extracted in CAP210ViewerDoc::BuildPackagedComponents
are for the shape rep and not for the location.  Usually these are the same but
not always. Need to look into this.

Feb 20. 2000
Have a memory leak in the properties list need to determine where I can free the
memory allocated for the displayed screens. Fixed by NOT using a strdup to 
copy the string when assigning it. I hope this won't cause problems.
(DONE MTK 2/20/00)

Need to display the requirement_properties associated with the component locations.
(DONE MTK 2/22/00 for placement fixed, still need to do mounting style)

Feb 22. 2000

Need to update Readme.txt file for version 1.2a, Look at save options for IDF,
release version of 1.2 didn't use "my_document_manager"(FIXED),
and FindItemNumber (IMPLEMENTED).

Need to recompile IDF ExpressX since I added complex instances to the working set.
(DONE KC)
Need to display Mechanical parts ASAP.

Work on saving changes when "placement fixed" is changed. (DONE MTK 2/24/00)
PackagedComponent::setPlacementFixed(BOOL fixed) is the model of how to control
the changes so that the user is prompted to save the file.

Feb 27, 2000

Look at save of IDF file it isn't clearing out the SDAI model. (DONE MTK 2/28/00)

March 3, 2000
Look at changing board thickness and component height.
(Board thickness done, but not saved to p21 MTK 3/4/00)
(Component Height done, but not saved to p21 MTK 3/6/00)


March 4, 2000
Find Item Number is not set to zero for each design!
(FIXED MTK 3/5/00)

Look at using double values for edit windows where valid.
(DONE MTK 3/5/00 works great!, checks values)

Set up package to edit height only when selected from the tree.
Look and x y for help on setting editablility.
(DONE MTK 3/5/00)

March 6, 2000
Removed Render from PackagedComponent need to test this.
(DONE MTK 3/7/00)

March 7, 2000
Need to create a "packaged_component" and "board_component"
classes for IDF since I keep having to hack up the "AP210"
one in order to support IDF.

March 11, 2000
The DLLs Mfc42.dll and Msvcrt.dll where required to run on a 
clean Win95 installation.  I believe that there are compile 
options that would allow me not to include these.

March 14, 2000

Need to get rid of ComponentReference

Pushing through the Z xy plane to put a component on the bottom
of the board is might be wrong need to rotate 180 degrees about
the x and y axis, after the component is located. (DONE MTK 2/22/00)

March 20, 2000

If you SAVEAS a file with the .210 extension and don't
explecitly call out the extension when you close the file
you get an error about not being able to find the .stp
version of the file.  Need to get the format of the model
and use it to set the document type in MFC.
(FIXED by changing the pathname, not the document type
still need to look into changing document type MTK 3/21/00)


The primary and secondary surfaces strings are shared between
packaged_components. setPackagedComponentSide() is moving all
the components from one side to the other. This needs to be
fixed! (DONE MTK 3/22/00)

Need to examine/test DoSave in doc's shouldn't need Rose to
set pathname.  At one time the extension was lost and I
had a problem when I went to close a document.
(MTK FIXED?)

March 26, 2000
// these and the next two functions should be encapsulated in
// a class. and these variables need to be determined for each
// PWBdatabase! 
SdaiADB primary_surface = sdaiNULL;
SdaiADB secondary_surface = sdaiNULL;
(MTK DONE)

March 28, 2000
Using setReadOnly and setEditable need to pick one,
I like setReadOnly
   // we want to edit the Height on this sheet
   m_packagePage.setReadOnly(FALSE);

April 1, 2000
Rose has a handle to peform perodic status updates, this could be used to implement a status bar.
The rosedesign function clrModified() should be called when a design is saved.

April 10, 2000
Need to keep the interconnect module and interconnect assembly physical_units in PWBDataBase.

June 14th, 2000
Unable to determine where SetModifiedFlag(TRUE) is called when the surface of a packaged_component is changed.

Sept, 2000

Added transparency to AP210GraphicObject and implemented it for BoardComponent.
Updated selection to select the component on "top".

Need to remove Side for PWBDataBase::getTransformationMatrix.
(Complete 9/12/00 MTK)

Oct 22 2000
Transparency doesn't work with an opengl32.dll from 1999 but does with one from 1996.

Nov. 1 2000

Added support for both the DIS and IS mappings for located interconnect module thickness.
Since I get the data from the step model often.  It makes since to have the BoardComponent
reference this property defintion for the gets and puts (and most likely creates in the future).
ditto for height.
By turning on VERBOSE I should be able to find and fix some benign error messages.
(MTK 11/1/2000)


Nov 11, 2000
Need to get rid of case where a PWBDatabase and an AP210Model are passed in.
This would make the code more portable.  In fact getting rid of the AP210Model
in favor of the database would be a good idea.  Maybe make an ExtactGeometry 
a data member of PWBDatabase.

Jan 6, 2001
#ifdef INSTANCEOF removes controls some code that isn't used.
It appears that it could be deleted.

Jan 17, 2001
Need to handle circles for drilled holes.

Jan 18, 2001
Need to use the AP210Model in the PWBDatabase object in ExtractGeometry
this will isolate the application better from toolkits.


define IDFDELETEBUG get demonstrate a bug with deleting the centers
of arches and circles when looking for the extent of the board when
display an IDF inport, (Doesn't appear to be a problem with 210 files)

March 13, 2001
Need to refine usage of CRA and MRA.
MRA dialog will display location and if the placement is fixed.
CRA will display transparency and height.
Confirm this idea with the CRA.pdf file in the ATX testcase.
