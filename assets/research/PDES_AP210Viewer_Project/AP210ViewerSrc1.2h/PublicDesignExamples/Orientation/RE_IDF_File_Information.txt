To All,

The library from SDRC was the problem. I've zipped everything up into one file to document what was accomplished.

The original subdirectory contains the files I originally sent and the corresponding AP210 file.

test_4.210 - AP210 AIM of SDRC files
test_4.ap210arm AP210 ARM of SDRC files
test_4.brd - SDRC board file
test_4.brd - SDRC library file
test_4_203.stp - AP203 of SDRC files
test_4_primary.JPG - primary side in AP210 Viewer
test_4_secondary.JPG - secondary side in AP210 Viewer
test_design_primary.jpg - primary side in SDRC
test_design_secondary.jpg - secondary side in SDRC

I'll try take a look at the 3D locations in test_4_203.stp and compare them with my OpenGL translation matrixes before the Tuesday call.  It looks like it going to rain this weekend so odds are I'll look at it.

Tom Thurman asked that I send the attached information to you for use with
the information we sent yesterday.  It is the library information that I
received back from SDRC and used to read in the component definition.
