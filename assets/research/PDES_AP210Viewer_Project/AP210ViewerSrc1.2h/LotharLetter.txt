Lothar and Giedrius,

I've been looking at the ap210_pcb1.stp file create at 2000-11-15T18:30:00 that I downloaded 
from your web site on Nov. 18th. My intent is to be able to view the file
in my AP210 viewer.  In it's present state the viewer would only display
the outline and thickness of the interconnect_module.  Currently the
viewer displays the outline with a thickness of zero for this file.
The file generally looks good in the sections that I've look at.
Below I've listed my findings.

	1) Uses interconnect_definition rather than physical_unit for the
	interconnect module. Since the IDF and ITI translators use
	physical_unit a slight modification was required.

	2) The ITI and IDF translators have implemented the interconnect_module_edge
	ARM object and you have the implemented interconnect_module_edge_surface
      ARM object.  I added code to find the interconnect_module_edge_surface data.
	This is an interesting finding since all three implementations appear to
	implement the interconnect_module_usage_view UoF but the ITI and IDF
	implementation also implement the interconnect_module_edge UoF and use
	it to specify the edge.

	3) I use the located_interconnect_module_thickness_requirement ARM object
	to specify the thickness of the interconnect module in the viewer.  You
	don't specify this requirement which is part of the
	interconnect_module_usage_view UoF.  You do appear to have some thickness
	data that seems to be specifying the thickness of a dielectric
	stratum (I really haven't looked at this in enough detail to be sure).

	My viewer allows the user to modify this thickness requirement, if it is 
	present.  I plan on adding the capability to add the thickness requirement
      if it is not present.  I'm not sure if I will do this before I get the
	next version of the viewer out.

I've unsuccessfully tried to view the ap210_pcb1.stp and TutorCPU.stp files.
I don't find this unexpected, so I'm not going to worry about it unless you do.

Once again this file looks very good.  Let me know if you create another version.
