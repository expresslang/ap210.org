<h3>Title:</h3>
<dd>Mounting Restriction Area Boundary

<h3>Design Source:</h3>
<dd><a href="MRABoundary.210">MRABoundary.210</a> created using
EMPilot IDF translator from <a href="MRABoundary.brd">MRABoundary.brd</a>.
It contains three placement restriction areas. One outer and two inner,
one of the inner areas will be used for the shape_representation
for the outer MRA’s interior boundary.

<dd>This approved SEDS calls out an approach that differs from the 
on taken here.  Therefore the solution presented here needs
to be reworked.
