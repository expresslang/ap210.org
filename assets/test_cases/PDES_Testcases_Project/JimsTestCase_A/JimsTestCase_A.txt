JimsTestCase_A

This test case consists of a rectangular board and one part nuber component placed 8 times on it.  Each component placement has a different orientation.  These Solid Edge V8 files were created using PCBto3D software by TLD, Inc., Bellevue, WA  98009 from the included IDF files.  Component part number, package, and reference designator data are stored in the Solid Edge assembly file for display to the user and extraction of IDF files.
