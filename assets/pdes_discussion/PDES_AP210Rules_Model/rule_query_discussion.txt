During review of difficulty with current rules model, it occurred to me that part of
the problem is that there is a query function that executes first and
puts data up on the 'fact' instance data set.
I see a Rule_mapping_function as mapping instance data in compliance with schema 1 to
instance data in compliance with schema 2.

So the question is: do you want to consider a Rule_function that is called a Rule_query_function or
a Rule_mapping_function?

It looks like the rules have the need for a query.
XSLT, Express-X and SQL are examples of implementations of queries, and should we define a UoF that would allow
you to specify what the query is.  It is easily as complex as the rules and maybe more so.

There is an argument that it could be included in the rules UoF.  
We think it is better to have an independent UoF. 
It is not within the scope of the rules uof to do the query because it has independent value.

source domain :--> query :-> target domain == view 
now the view includes the reference path parts.

for existing rules UoF, every cell would be a name value pair??
