= AP210 Research Data Archive Now Available with DOI Citation

We are pleased to announce the launch of the **AP210 Research Data Archive**, making collaborative research between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and PDES Inc. more accessible to the public.

== A  Resource for Electronic Design Research

The archive, accessible at https://www.expresslang.org/ap210-research-data/[www.expresslang.org/ap210-research-data], provides complete, downloadable datasets from six major research projects that have shaped the development and application of ISO 10303-210 (AP 210) for electronic and mechatronic design.

These datasets offer access to  test cases, real-world examples, and reference implementations.

== Formal Citation with DOI

The archive has been assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) through Zenodo: **https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16496290**

This DOI enables proper academic citation of the datasets, supporting reproducible research and acknowledging the significant contributions of NIST and PDES Inc. to the electronics industry. When using data from this archive, researchers should cite:

https://github.com/expresslang/ap210-research-data
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16496290
----

== What's Available

The archive encompasses six research areas:

**NIST Research Projects:**

* **CFD Analysis Data**: Computational fluid dynamics models for electronic assembly thermal management
* **Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing**:  GDT data for electronic connectors and IC packages  
* **SPICE Integration**: Circuit simulation data integrated with AP210 mechanical design models

**PDES Inc. Projects:**

* **AP210 Viewer**: Visualization tool data and testing examples
* **IDF to AP210 Conversion**: Complete translation examples from legacy Intermediate Data Format to modern AP210

Each dataset includes:

* AP210 STEP files (.stp, .210)
* Reference implementations and validation test cases
* Technical documentation and methodologies
* Associated publications and research papers

== Open Science Commitment

Datasets are released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0).

== Technical Infrastructure

The archive is hosted on GitHub Pages providing:

* Organized directory structure for easy navigation
* Individual README files for each project dataset
* Comprehensive data dictionary and technical specifications
* Version control and change tracking through Git

== Integration with AP210.org

The research data archive is fully integrated with the existing AP210.org research section.

Visitors can access the archive through:

* Individual project pages with targeted dataset links
* The comprehensive link:/research/Research_Data_Archive[Research Data Archive] overview page
* Direct navigation to specific datasets of interest

The archive will continue to evolve, with plans to add new datasets as research projects are completed and to enhance documentation based on community feedback.

== Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and PDES Inc. for their commitment to open science and their permission to make these valuable research datasets publicly available. Special recognition goes to the researchers and engineers who developed these datasets through years of dedicated work. In particular, the efforts of Dr. Jamie Stori, Allison Barnard Feeney, Michael Keenan, and Kevin Brady are acknowledged. Additionally the entire PDES Electrical project team is acknowledged for their efforts.
